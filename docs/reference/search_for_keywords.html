<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 1  Global pattern of optic flow can distinguish between different types of self-motion, such as rotation versus translation and forward/backward translation from up/down or side-to-side translation. The circumstances in which human observers produce different types of eye, head, and body motions differ across the life span, in part due to changes in locomotor abilities and declines in the frequency of passive locomotion. Scene geometry and body posture and position also contribute to the statistics of optic flow. Previous research has shown that 9.5 month-old infants undergoing passive locomotion -- carried by their parents in a forward facing carrier -- view different patterns and speeds of retinal- and head-centered optic flow (Raudies et al., 2012). Here we assess the patterns and speeds of head-centered optic flow experienced by infants across a wider range of ages, postures, and geometries. The data come from videos recorded from infant and adult observers who wore head-mounted cameras while they performed simple natural activities -- walking, sitting, playing with toys, and interacting with caregivers. We estimated optic flow from short (~30 sec) long segments using the method of Brox et al. (2004). From the flow estimates, we characterized the relative frequency of global rotation (yaw, pitch, and roll) and translation (forward/backward, up/down, and side to side) patterns and overall speeds. We found that infants who are not moving passively view translational flow patterns significantly more often than infant/mother dyads in paired locomotion. Further, infants who are not coupled to an adult in locomotion view a broader, wider, and slower distribution of flow speeds. Thus, the statistics of optic flow differ depending on the type (active vs. passive) self-motion. This implies that the relative frequency of experienced flow patterns and speeds may change substantially across development. Computer vision-based techniques permit a detailed analysis of the statistics of the natural visual environment during development.</span>

Their reaching and avoidance responses were compared in two postures, an experienced sitting posture and a less familiar crawling posture. The babies avoided reaching over risky gaps in the sitting posture but fell into risky gaps while attempting to reach in the crawling posture. This dissociation between developmental changes in posture suggests that (a) each postural milestone represents a different, modularly organized control system and (b) infants' adaptive avoidance responses are based on information about their postural stability relative to the gap size. Moreover, the results belie previous accounts suggesting that avoidance of a disparity in depth of the ground surface depends on general knowledge such as fear of heights, associations between depth information and falling, or knowledge that the body cannot be supported in empty space.</span>

At the same time, infants' bodies and skills continually change. The changing demands of everyday locomotion require infants to adapt locomotion to the properties of the terrain and to their own physical abilities. This Monograph examines how infants acquire adaptive locomotion in a novel task--going up and down slopes. Infants were tested longitudinally from their first week of crawling until several weeks after they began walking. Everyday locomotor experience played a central role in adaptive responding. Over weeks of crawling, infants' judgments became increasingly accurate, and exploration became increasingly efficient. There was no transfer over the transition from crawling to walking. Instead, infants learned, all over again, how to cope with slopes from an upright position. Findings indicate that learning generalized from everyday experience traveling over flat surfaces at home but that learning was specific to infants' typical method of locomotion and vantage point. Moreover, learning was not the result of simple associations between a particular locomotor response and a particular slope. Rather, infants learned to gauge their abilities on-line as they encountered each hill at the start of the trial. Change in locomotor responses and exploratory movements revealed a process of differentiation and selection spurred by changes in infants' everyday experience, body dimensions, and locomotor proficiency on flat ground.</span>

Despite its importance for spatial perception and for guiding locomotion, very little is known about how the ability to perceive one’s direction of motion, or heading, from optic flow develops early in life. In this article, we report the results of 3 experiments that tested the abilities of 4-month-old infants to discriminate optic flow patterns simulating different directions of self-motion. The combined results from 2 different experimental paradigms suggest that 4-month-olds discriminate optic flow patterns that simulate only large (&gt;32 deg) changes in the direction of the observer’s motion through space. This suggests that prior to the onset of locomotion, there are limitations on infants’ abilities to process patterns of optic flow related to self-motion.</span>

As a result, the statistics of visual motion infant observers experience differ from adults in some situations. We ask whether these differences apply more generally, and if so, what factors account for them. In one analysis, we simulate the effects of changes in body posture, speed of locomotion, and surface geometry on motion statistics. In a second analysis, we empirically measure the statistics of visual motion experienced by observers across the first year of life using infant-perspective videos captured during episodes when infants were moving through space or were stationary. We include samples of infants in from North America and those from India, to assess how variations in cultural practices influence infants' visual experiences. We find that fast laminar motion patterns dominate the visual input young infants experience and that cultural differences play a small role in shaping visual motion experiences.</span>

How do people select a particular action among equally possible alternatives? In six experiments, we determined whether action selection is consistent and biased toward one decision by observing participants’ decisions to go over or under a horizontal bar set at varying heights. We assessed the height at which participants transitioned from going over to under the bar within a “gray zone”—the range of bar heights at which going over and under were both possible. In Experiment 1, participants’ transition points were consistently located near the upper boundary of the gray zone, indicating a bias to go over rather than under the bar. Moreover, transitional behaviors were clustered tightly into a small region, indicating that decisions were highly consistent. Subsequent experiments examined potential influences on action selection. In Experiment 2, participants wore ankle weights to increase the cost of going over the bar. In Experiment 3, they were tested on a padded surface that made crawling under the bar more comfortable. In Experiment 4, we introduced a secondary task that required participants to crawl immediately after navigating the bar. None of these manipulations altered participants’ decisions relative to Experiment 1. In Experiment 5, participants started in a crawling position, which led to significantly lower transition points. In Experiment 6, we tested 5- to 6-year-old children as in Experiment 1 to determine the effects of social pressure on action selection. Children displayed lower transition points, larger transition regions, and reduced ability to go over the bar compared to adults. Across experiments, results indicate that adults have a strong and robust bias for upright locomotion.</span>

Here we develop a set of techniques to study the optic flow experienced by infants and mothers during locomotion as a first step toward a broader analysis of the statistics of the natural visual environment during development.</span>

To test whether classic findings from screen-based studies generalize to real-world visual exploration and to compare natural visual exploration in infants and adults, we tested observers in a new paradigm that combines critical aspects of both previous techniques: free viewing during real-world visual exploration. Mothers and their 9-month-old infants wore head-mounted eye trackers while mothers carried their infants in a forward-facing infant carrier through a series of indoor hallways. Demands for visual guidance of action were minimal in mothers and absent for infants, so both engaged in free viewing while moving through the environment. Similar to screen-based studies, during free viewing in the real world low-level saliency was related to gaze direction. In contrast to screen-based studies, only infants - not adults - were biased to look at people, participants of both ages did not show a classic center bias, and mothers and infants did not display high levels of inter-observer consistency. Results indicate that several aspects of visual exploration of a flat screen display do not generalize to visual exploration in the real world.</span>

However, common paradigms for studying infant-caregiver interaction oversimplify the act of social looking by placing infants and caregivers in stationary positions facing each other. In more naturalistic settings, infants and caregivers must coordinate movements of their bodies and heads to look at each another amid the demands of other ongoing actions. We hypothesized that social looking for each member of the dyad would be affected by 1) the motor costs of looking and 2) competition between the social partner’s face and other visual targets. To test these hypotheses, twelve-month-old infants and their parents wore head-mounted eye trackers to provide a moment-by-moment measure of whether each member of the dyad looked at the other’s face or looked at toys. Findings revealed that motor costs did affect looking: Social looking varied according to the body posture of infants and caregivers. Transitions between postures changed the likelihood of face looking by altering the observer’s viewpoint and the availability of the social partner’s face. Moreover, the presence of other visual targets greatly impacted infants’ but not caregivers’ social looking: Infants rarely looked at their parents’ faces but often looked at toys. In contrast, parents frequently looked at both infants’ faces and toys.</span>

Recent research suggests that locomotor exploration is not primarily directed toward reaching distant people, places or things. We asked whether a room with toys designed to encourage movement (stroller, ball, etc.) elicits more locomotor exploration than a room with no toys. Surprisingly, 15-month-old infants produced the same quantity of locomotion in both rooms—even though most walking bouts involved toys when available. Our findings suggest that mere space to move is sufficient to elicit locomotion. However, the quality of locomotor exploration differed. Infants in the toy condition explored a larger percent of the room, and spent a smaller percent of the session within 100 cm of their caregiver. Thus, while not required to elicit locomotion, the presence of alluring destinations seem to encourage infants to travel to new and unexplored areas.</span>

We examined cruisers' understanding of support for upright locomotion under four conditions: cruising over a wooden handrail at chest height, a large gap in the handrail, a wobbly unstable handrail, and an ill positioned low handrail. Infants distinguished among the support properties of the handrails with differential attempts to cruise and handrail-specific forms of haptic exploration and gait modifications. They consistently attempted the wood handrail, rarely attempted the gap, and occasionally attempted the low and wobbly handrails. On the wood and gap handrails, attempt rates matched the probability of cruising successfully; but on the low and wobbly handrails, attempt rates under- and over-estimated the probability of success, respectively. Haptic exploration was most frequent and varied on the wobbly handrail, and gait modifications-including previously undocumented "knee cruising"-were most frequent and effective on the low handrail.

Gaze patterns in response to the focus of radial optic flow were measured in human infants (N = 100, 4–18 months) and in adults (N = 20) using an eye-tracking technique. Overall, although the adults showed an advantage in detecting the focus of an expansion flow (representing forward locomotion) against that of a contraction flow (representing backward locomotion), infants younger than 1 year showed an advantage in detecting the focus of a contraction flow. Infants aged between 13 and 18 months showed no significant advantage in detecting the focus in either the expansion or in the contraction flow. The uniqueness of the gaze patterns in response to the focus of radial optic flow in infants shows that the visual information necessary to perceive heading direction potentially differs between younger and mature individuals.</span>

Natural free play represents the foundation of infant learning, but we know little about how infants play, how play unfolds in real time and across development, and how individual and group differences promote infant learning and development through play. To answer these questions, the PLAY project will collect, code, and share 900 hours of video collected in the homes of children at 12, 18, and 24 months of age drawn from 30 sites across North America.\n\nThe aim of the project is to develop a new approach to developmental science that enables (1) “big” data science for researchers who would not otherwise have access; (2) a communal, low-cost means of collecting and coding data that retains the autonomy of individual labs; and (3) a plan for leveraging diverse expertise to address a common goal.\n\nThis volume consists of materials discussed at a workshop held at NICHD on December 16, 2016 supported by NICHD, LEGO Foundation, and New York University.</span>

At 11 months, all infants were experienced crawlers; at 13 months, half began to walk independently. At each session, mothers reported demographic information, infants' locomotor history, and receptive and productive language using the long form of the MCDI. To confirm infants' locomotor status (crawler or walker) and examine locomotor proficiency, infants were observed crawling and walking on a marked 3-foot runner. Three published papers report infants' object interactions, object carrying, and maternal responses to infants' object sharing.</span>

A longstanding assumption is that infants primarily crawl or walk to reach destinations viewed while stationary. However, many bouts of spontaneous locomotion do not end at new people, places, or things. Study 1 showed that half of 10- and 13- month-old crawlers’ (N = 29) bouts end at destinations—more than previously found with walkers. Study 2 confirmed that, although infants do not commonly go to destinations, 12-month-old crawlers go to proportionally more destinations than age-matched walkers (N = 16). Head-mounted eye tracking revealed that, crawlers and walkers mostly take steps in place while fixating something within reach. When infants do go to a destination, they take straight, short paths to a target fixated while stationary.\n\nFor videos of full sessions, see volume links.</span>

Here, we illustrate the Overlapping Waves Model with video clips from several studies in infant and child motor development.

Longitudinal observations show that strategies entered infants' repertoires at various ages and changed in frequency as infants became more accurate at detecting affordances for descent over weeks of crawling and walking. See links for Illustration #1-Longitudinal.\nCross-sectional observations show that individual infants use multiple strategies within a single session.

However, despite the robust relation between elapsed time (months walking) and skill, practice is likely constrained and facilitated by infants’ home environments, sociodemographic influences, and spontaneous activity. Individual pathways are tremendously diverse in the timing of walk onset and the trajectory of improvement, and presumably, the amount and type of practice. So, what factors affect the development of walking skill? We examined the role of months walking, walk onset age, spontaneous locomotor activity, body dimensions, and environmental factors on the development of walking skill in two sociodemographically distinct samples (ns = 38 and 44) of 13-, 15-, and 19-month-old infants. Months walking best predicted how well infants walked, but environmental factors and spontaneous activity explained additional variance in walking skill. Specifically, less crowded homes, a larger percentage of time in spontaneous walking, and a smaller percentage of short walking bouts predicted more mature walking. Walk onset age differed by sample but did not affect walking skill. Findings indicate that elapsed time since walk onset remains a robust predictor of walking skill, but environmental factors and spontaneous activity also contribute to infants’ practice, thereby affecting walking skill.</span>

Navigating the everyday environment requires the ability to generate a wide repertoire of actions, select the appropriate action for the current situation, and implement it quickly and accurately. We used a new, adjustable barrier paradigm to assess flexibility of motor actions in 20 17-month-old (8 girls) and 14 13-month-old (7 girls) walking infants, and a comparative sample of 14 adults (8 women). Most participants were white, non-Hispanic, and middle class. Participants navigated under barriers normalized to their standing height (overhead, eye-, chest-, hip-, and knee-heights). Decreases in barrier height required lower postures for passage. Every participant altered their initial walking posture according to barrier height for every trial, and all but 2 13-month-olds found solutions for passage. Compared to infants, adults displayed a wider variety of strategies (squat-walking, half-kneeling, etc.), found more appropriate solutions based on barrier height (ducked at eye-height and low-crawled at knee-height), and implemented their solutions quickly (within 4 seconds) and accurately (without bumping their heads against the barrier). Infants frequently crawled even when the barrier height did not warrant a low posture, displayed multiple postural shifts prior to passage and thus took longer to go, and often bumped their heads. Infants’ improvements were more related to age than to walking experience. Thus, development of flexibility likely involves the contributions of multiple domains—motor, perception, and cognition—that facilitate strategy selection and implementation.</span>

Infants can only learn the words that they hear. We tested whether infants’ actions affect the words that caregivers say—specifically whether infant locomotion influences caregivers’ language about locomotion. Compared to crawling infants, walkers travel greater distances (Adolph, et al, 2012). Does enhanced locomotion in walkers influence the verbs that caregivers say? We hypothesized that walking creates new opportunities for verb learning. \n\nTo disentangle locomotor ability from age, we observed same-aged crawlers and walkers (16 13-month-old crawlers and 16 13-month-old walkers) and an older group of walkers (16 18-month-olds) during two hours of activity at home. Mothers’ language was transcribed verbatim. We then identified each “locomotor verb” (e.g., “come,” “bring”) that mothers said, and each bout of infant crawling and walking.\n\nWalkers’ enhanced locomotion indeed opened new opportunities for verb learning. Although mothers’ language overall was more frequent to older compared to younger infants, their locomotor verbs were more frequent to walkers than to crawlers. Preliminary findings show that caregivers directed more utterances to 18-month-olds (M = 2,006.00, SD = 579.02) compared to 13-month-old crawlers (M = 1,553.75, SD = 728.42) and walkers (M = 1,363.50, SD = 619.29), F (2, 31) = 3.23, p = .052. Notably, caregivers directed twice as many locomotor verbs to 13- and 18-month-old walkers (M = 53.13, SD = 15.40; M = 53.00, SD = 25.14, respectively) compared with 13-month-old crawlers (M = 25.25, SD = 12.87), F (2, 31) = 5.46, p = .01. Moreover, mothers’ locomotor verbs were related to infants’ moment-to-moment locomotion: Infants who moved more frequently received more locomotor verbs compared to infants who moved less, r(26) = .42, p = .035. Findings indicate that locomotor development leads to more advanced forms of infant activity, which consequently prompts caregivers to use more advanced language.</span>
