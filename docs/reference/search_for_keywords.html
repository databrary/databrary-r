two very different paradigms: free viewing of flat screen displays in desk-mounted eye-tracking studies and real-world visual guidance of action in head-mounted eye-tracking studies. To test whether classic findings from screen-based studies generalize to real-world visual exploration and to compare natural visual exploration in infants and adults, we tested observers in a new paradigm that combines critical aspects of both previous techniques: free viewing during real-world visual exploration. Mothers and their 9-month-old infants wore head-mounted eye trackers while mothers carried their infants in a forward-facing infant carrier through a series of indoor hallways. Demands for visual guidance of action were minimal in mothers and absent for infants, so both engaged in free viewing while moving through the environment. Similar to screen-based studies, during free viewing in the real world low-level saliency was related to gaze direction. In contrast to screen-based studies, only infants - not adults - were biased to look at people, participants of both ages did not show a classic center bias, and mothers and infants did not display high levels of inter-observer consistency. Results indicate that several aspects of visual exploration of a flat screen display do not generalize to visual exploration in the real world.</span>

of developmental research. However, common paradigms for studying infant-caregiver interaction oversimplify the act of social looking by placing infants and caregivers in stationary positions facing each other. In more naturalistic settings, infants and caregivers must coordinate movements of their bodies and heads to look at each another amid the demands of other ongoing actions. We hypothesized that social looking for each member of the dyad would be affected by 1) the motor costs of looking and 2) competition between the social partner’s face and other visual targets. To test these hypotheses, twelve-month-old infants and their parents wore head-mounted eye trackers to provide a moment-by-moment measure of whether each member of the dyad looked at the other’s face or looked at toys. Findings revealed that motor costs did affect looking: Social looking varied according to the body posture of infants and caregivers. Transitions between postures changed the likelihood of face looking by altering the observer’s viewpoint and the availability of the social partner’s face. Moreover, the presence of other visual targets greatly impacted infants’ but not caregivers’ social looking: Infants rarely looked at their parents’ faces but often looked at toys. In contrast, parents frequently looked at both infants’ faces and toys.</span>

                                             What incites infant locomotion? Recent research suggests that locomotor exploration is not primarily directed toward reaching distant people, places or things. We asked whether a room with toys designed to encourage movement (stroller, ball, etc.) elicits more locomotor exploration than a room with no toys. Surprisingly, 15-month-old infants produced the same quantity of locomotion in both rooms—even though most walking bouts involved toys when available. Our findings suggest that mere space to move is sufficient to elicit locomotion. However, the quality of locomotor exploration differed. Infants in the toy condition explored a larger percent of the room, and spent a smaller percent of the session within 100 cm of their caregiver. Thus, while not required to elicit locomotion, the presence of alluring destinations seem to encourage infants to travel to new and unexplored areas.</span>

                "Cruising" infants can only walk using external support to augment their balance. We examined cruisers' understanding of support for upright locomotion under four conditions: cruising over a wooden handrail at chest height, a large gap in the handrail, a wobbly unstable handrail, and an ill positioned low handrail. Infants distinguished among the support properties of the handrails with differential attempts to cruise and handrail-specific forms of haptic exploration and gait modifications. They consistently attempted the wood handrail, rarely attempted the gap, and occasionally attempted the low and wobbly handrails. On the wood and gap handrails, attempt rates matched the probability of cruising successfully; but on the low and wobbly handrails, attempt rates under- and over-estimated the probability of success, respectively. Haptic exploration was most frequent and varied on the wobbly handrail, and gait modifications-including previously undocumented "knee cruising"-were most frequent and effective on the low handrail. Results are discussed in terms of developmental changes in the meaning of support.</span>

of life. As a result, the statistics of visual motion infant observers experience differ from adults in some situations. We ask whether these differences apply more generally, and if so, what factors account for them. In one analysis, we simulate the effects of changes in body posture, speed of locomotion, and surface geometry on motion statistics. In a second analysis, we empirically measure the statistics of visual motion experienced by observers across the first year of life using infant-perspective videos captured during episodes when infants were moving through space or were stationary. We include samples of infants in from North America and those from India, to assess how variations in cultural practices influence infants' visual experiences. We find that fast laminar motion patterns dominate the visual input young infants experience and that cultural differences play a small role in shaping visual motion experiences.</span>

achieve a goal. How do people select a particular action among equally possible alternatives? In six experiments, we determined whether action selection is consistent and biased toward one decision by observing participants’ decisions to go over or under a horizontal bar set at varying heights. We assessed the height at which participants transitioned from going over to under the bar within a “gray zone”—the range of bar heights at which going over and under were both possible. In Experiment 1, participants’ transition points were consistently located near the upper boundary of the gray zone, indicating a bias to go over rather than under the bar. Moreover, transitional behaviors were clustered tightly into a small region, indicating that decisions were highly consistent. Subsequent experiments examined potential influences on action selection. In Experiment 2, participants wore ankle weights to increase the cost of going over the bar. In Experiment 3, they were tested on a padded surface that made crawling under the bar more comfortable. In Experiment 4, we introduced a secondary task that required participants to crawl immediately after navigating the bar. None of these manipulations altered participants’ decisions relative to Experiment 1. In Experiment 5, participants started in a crawling position, which led to significantly lower transition points. In Experiment 6, we tested 5- to 6-year-old children as in Experiment 1 to determine the effects of social pressure on action selection. Children displayed lower transition points, larger transition regions, and reduced ability to go over the bar compared to adults. Across experiments, results indicate that adults have a strong and robust bias for upright locomotion.</span>

                                        Crawling Example 1: Experimenter carrying baby, mom and experimenter at end of walkway, soft carpet crawling surface. Illustrates use of toys to lure baby. Experimenters are particularly talented.\n\nCrawling Example 2: Experimenter carrying baby, mom at end of walkway, gridded high-density foam surface. Example of how to run crawling gait when only one experimenter is available.\n\nCrawling Example 3: Experimenter carrying baby, mom and experimenter at end of walkway, gridded high-density foam surface, infant wearing head-mounted eye tracker.\n\nLocomotor histories correspond to pdf's by Subject #. Note how experimenter clearly defines the criteria over and over. She zeroes in on the correct age through a "negotiation" with the parent. If parent gives an age, experimenter returns with a date. If parent offers a date, experimenter returns with an age. Then experimenter tries to get parent to remember specific event when baby was walking/cruising/crawling (a holiday, birthday, special outing).\n\nBlank form for entering parent's report about the baby's locomotion. Date fields on the right provide a "cheat sheet" so that the experimenter can quickly translate dates into ages and ages into dates.\n\nExcerpt of testing sitting proficiency: experimenter tests number of seconds the baby is able to maintain upright posture with hands up in the air while doing a long sit and a short sit. Experimenter also tests sitting balance using the Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control (SATCo).</span>

The head-mounted cameras recorded infants' eye position and field of view. A wheeled camera alongside the platform recorded infants' locomotion from a side view. Caregivers stood at the far end of the walkway and held toys at low, medium, and high elevations to provide targets for infants' gaze. An additional group of 13-month-olds crawled or walked over a gridded platform wearing an electromagnetic motion tracker (Ascension TrakSTAR) to record position and orientation of their heads. In every study, parents provided retrospective reports of infants' locomotor experience and an experimenter measured infants' body dimensions. Additional pilot data include changes in procedure. Videos from a subset of infants were excluded for various reasons.</span>

crawlers decided whether to cross wide and narrow bridges (2-60 cm) spanning a large (71-cm) or small (17-cm) drop-off to reach their caregivers who encouraged them from the far side of the bridge. An additional group of 14-month-olds walked over a "visual bridge" apparatus, designed to match an apparatus with a real bridge and drop-off. Here, the drop-off and bridge were only illusory. Bridge widths were presented with a psychophysical staircase procedure and each infant received ~40 trials. In each study, an experimenter rescued infants if they fell. In every study, infants' behavior was recorded from side, front, and overhead views, parents provided retrospective reports of infants' crawling, walking, and falling experience, and an experimenter measured infants' body dimensions. Additional pilot data include various age groups, drop-off heights, and procedures. Videos from a subset of infants were excluded for various reasons.</span>

decided whether they could squeeze sideways through narrow doorways and inch sideways along narrow ledges while walking over a raised platform. Doorways and ledges varied in width from 0 to 64 cm. Doorway and ledge widths were presented with a psychophysical staircase procedure and each participant received ~ 33 trials per condition. Participants' behaviors were recorded from overhead frontal and side views; doorway and ledge widths were also recorded. At the end of each session, participants' body size was measured in the doorway.</span>

these change across development, and how they influence the maturation of motion-sensitive brain networks. Here we develop a set of techniques to study the optic flow experienced by infants and mothers during locomotion as a first step toward a broader analysis of the statistics of the natural visual environment during development.</span>

A longstanding assumption is that infants primarily crawl or walk to reach destinations viewed while stationary. However, many bouts of spontaneous locomotion do not end at new people, places, or things. Study 1 showed that half of 10- and 13- month-old crawlers’ (N = 29) bouts end at destinations—more than previously found with walkers. Study 2 confirmed that, although infants do not commonly go to destinations, 12-month-old crawlers go to proportionally more destinations than age-matched walkers (N = 16). Head-mounted eye tracking revealed that, crawlers and walkers mostly take steps in place while fixating something within reach. When infants do go to a destination, they take straight, short paths to a target fixated while stationary.\n\nFor videos of full sessions, see volume links.</span>

"Overlapping Waves Model" proposes that strategies enter children's repertoires at different times and change in frequency over development as behavior becomes more adaptive and functional. Here, we illustrate the Overlapping Waves Model with video clips from several studies in infant and child motor development. (See links for specific papers relevant to the excerpts).\n\nIllustration #1: Infants' use of various strategies for descending impossibly steep slopes (backing feet first, sliding head first, sitting, crawling, walking, avoiding descent). Longitudinal observations show that strategies entered infants' repertoires at various ages and changed in frequency as infants became more accurate at detecting affordances for descent over weeks of crawling and walking. See links for Illustration #1-Longitudinal.\nCross-sectional observations show that individual infants use multiple strategies within a single session. See links for Illustration #1-Cross-sectional.\n\nIllustration #2: Walking infants use multiple strategies for descending drop-offs (backing feet first, sitting, crawling, walking, avoiding descent). See links for Illustration #2-Drop-offs.\n\nIllustration #3: 4-year-olds use multiple strategies for pounding a peg with a hammer (radial grip, ulnar grip, two-handed grip, etc.).

and guide locomotion under challenging conditions? This experiment investigated the real-time process of visual and haptic exploration in 14-month-old infants as they decided whether and how to walk over challenging terrain—a series of bridges varying in width. Infants’ direction of gaze was recorded with a head-mounted eye tracker and their haptic exploration and locomotor actions were captured on video. Infants’ exploration was an organized, efficient sequence of visual, haptic, and locomotor behaviors. They used visual exploration from a distance as an initial assessment on nearly every bridge. Visual information subsequently prompted gait modifications while approaching narrow bridges and haptic exploration at the edge of the bridge. Results confirm predictions about the sequential, ramping-up process of exploration and the distinct roles of vision and touch. Exploration, however, was not a guarantee of adaptive decisions. With walking experience, exploratory behaviors became increasingly efficient and infants were better able to interpret the resulting perceptual information in terms of whether it was safe to walk.</span>

radial optic flow is a valid visual cue used to perceive and control the heading direction of animals. Gaze patterns in response to the focus of radial optic flow were measured in human infants (N = 100, 4–18 months) and in adults (N = 20) using an eye-tracking technique. Overall, although the adults showed an advantage in detecting the focus of an expansion flow (representing forward locomotion) against that of a contraction flow (representing backward locomotion), infants younger than 1 year showed an advantage in detecting the focus of a contraction flow. Infants aged between 13 and 18 months showed no significant advantage in detecting the focus in either the expansion or in the contraction flow. The uniqueness of the gaze patterns in response to the focus of radial optic flow in infants shows that the visual information necessary to perceive heading direction potentially differs between younger and mature individuals.</span>

                                        The Play &amp; Learning Across a Year (PLAY) project serves as a model system for doing development science from a "big" data approach. Natural free play represents the foundation of infant learning, but we know little about how infants play, how play unfolds in real time and across development, and how individual and group differences promote infant learning and development through play. To answer these questions, the PLAY project will collect, code, and share 900 hours of video collected in the homes of children at 12, 18, and 24 months of age drawn from 30 sites across North America.\n\nThe aim of the project is to develop a new approach to developmental science that enables (1) “big” data science for researchers who would not otherwise have access; (2) a communal, low-cost means of collecting and coding data that retains the autonomy of individual labs; and (3) a plan for leveraging diverse expertise to address a common goal.\n\nThis volume consists of materials discussed at a workshop held at NICHD on December 16, 2016 supported by NICHD, LEGO Foundation, and New York University.</span>

At 11 months, all infants were experienced crawlers; at 13 months, half began to walk independently. At each session, mothers reported demographic information, infants' locomotor history, and receptive and productive language using the long form of the MCDI. To confirm infants' locomotor status (crawler or walker) and examine locomotor proficiency, infants were observed crawling and walking on a marked 3-foot runner. Three published papers report infants' object interactions, object carrying, and maternal responses to infants' object sharing.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 20 This dataset includes videos of real-life falls experienced by older adult residents of long-term care homes.\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION:\n\nThe dataset contains 300 videos of falls experienced by 118 adults (57 women who accounted for 175 falls, and 61 men who accounted for 125 falls). The dataset also contains individual and master spreadsheets containing information on the video frame rate and resolution, the status of the person who experienced the fall, and reported injuries related to the fall. At the time of falling, the individuals ranged in age from 58 years to 98 years (mean age = 82.8 years, SD = 7.6 years). All individuals captured falling were residing in two partnering long-term care facilities in British Columbia, where the falls occurred. All falls occurred in common areas of the long-term care homes (lounges, dining rooms and hallways). No cameras were installed in bedrooms or bathrooms.\n\nEach individual recorded falling, or their decision maker, has provided informed consent for sharing their fall video footage for the purposes of research and education. 98 participants provided permission to share both their videos and their medical records with researchers. 20 participants only consented for sharing of their videos, and did not consent for sharing of medical records. 14 participants (7 women who accounted for 15 falls, 7 men who accounted for 13 falls) consented to have their videos shared publicly; therefore, 28 videos (mean age = 84.2 years, SD = 7.8 years) in the dataset are available to the public. Faces on the videos have been blurred. \n\nIn cases where a given fall was captured by more than one camera, the views from the individual cameras have been combined into a single video file. Most falls (n=158) were captured from only one camera view. For 99 falls, videos are included from two camera views, and for 43 falls, videos are included from three or more camera views.\n\nThe falls were recorded on video at a frame rate between 3 and 33 frames per second (fps). The camera resolution ranged from 352 x 240 pixels to 1920 x 1080 pixels. \n\nAll videos labelled as “Uploaded August 2018” in the “Groups” column have been converted to 640 x 480 pixels and a frame rate of 24 fps or 30 fps. In cases where the original frame rate was less than 30 fps (or 24 fps), this will have resulted in duplication of successive images in the video. All videos labelled as “Uploaded November 2020” and “Uploaded June 2021” in the “Groups” column have been exported to match the frame size and the frame rate of their original videos. The original frame rate and resolution are noted in Excel spreadsheets accompanying each video.\n\nAll videos are in mp4 format.\n\nSTRUCTURE OF THE DATASET:\n\nEach folder contains a video (.mp4) file, depicting a single fall event. For falls captured by more than one camera, the views from the individual cameras have been combined into a single video file. Each video is named as [analyzed video number]_[date of fall (mmddyyyy)].mp4.\n\nEach folder also contains an Excel file (.xlsx) with information about the fall event shown in the video. The information includes the number of camera views, the original frame rate and resolution of the video, and information on the individual who experienced the fall, collected from the fall incident report and minimum data set (MDS) assessment taken within 6 months of the fall. For the videos where the participant did not consent to share their medical information, information is not provided on ADL score, CPS score, Vision score, disease diagnoses, and medications (marked as "-" in each of these categories). The Excel files are named as [analyzed video number].xlsx. \n\nA master spreadsheet contains data from fall incident report and MDS for all 300 falls ("Master spreadsheet - Falls experienced by older adult residents in long-term care homes.xlsx"). For the videos where the participant did not consent to share their medical information, information is not provided on ADL score, CPS score, Vision score, disease diagnoses, and medications (marked as "-" in each of these categories).\n\nThe cause of fall, activity at time of fall, and mobility aid at time of fall descriptors (columns M, N, O in the Master Spreadsheet) were assessed by a team of three trained raters using a validated questionnaire. Details of the Fall Video Analysis Questionnaire development and validation can be found in the following publication:\n\nYang, Y., Schonnop R., Feldman F., &amp; Robinovitch S.N. (2013) Development and validation of a questionnaire for analyzing real-life falls in long-term care captured on video. BMC Geriatrics 13(40). \n\nThe spreadsheet also includes information on habitual use of mobility aid (column R in the Master Spreadsheet). “Habitual Use of Mobility Aid” refers to the recommended use of a mobility aid retrieved from the MDS of the participant, while “Mobility Aid at Time of Fall” refers to the use of a mobility aid in the specific video. The mobility aid of habitual use may not match with the video.\n\nA master spreadsheet also contains injury data information for the recorded falls. A 7-day follow up is done for all falls to assess injuries in more detail. "Serious" injuries are injuries that required hospitalization, a diagnostic procedure (such as x-ray), or sutures; all other injuries are considered "moderate." Furthermore, the order of injuries does not reflect severity.\n\nA reduced spreadsheet contains information on the above categories for the 28 publicly shared videos (“Reduced Spreadsheet for Publicly Shared Videos - Falls experienced by older adult residents in long-term care homes”). \n\nDATA COLUMNS (in first tab “Videos” of master spreadsheet):\n\n- Video Identifier\n- Participant Identifier (of the individual captured falling)\n- Views (number of camera views of the fall)\n- Original Video Resolution (pixels)\n- Original Video Frame Rate (frames per second (fps))\n- Edited Video Resolution and Frame Rate\n- Age (years)\n- Sex\n- Height (cm)\n- Weight (kg)\n- Date of Fall\n- Cause of Fall\n- Activity at Time of Fall\n- Mobility Aid at Time of Fall\n- Falls within Last 6 Months\n- Fractures within Last 6 Months\n- Habitual Use of Mobility Aid (habitual; may not match video)\n- ADL Self-Performance Hierarchy Scale (0-6, with 6 being the most impaired)*\n- Cognitive Performance Scale (0-6, with 6 being the most impaired)*\n- Vision Patterns Score (0-4, with 4 being the most impaired)*\n- Disease Diagnoses* \n- # of Medications per Week* \n- Type of Medications* \n\n*Not provided in the reduced public spreadsheet\n\nNote: The spreadsheet contains a key tab (“Videos Key”) that explains the nature of the data (classifications and labels) in the “Videos” tab.\n\nDATA COLUMNS: (in second tab “Injury Data” of master spreadsheet):\n\n- Injury resulted\n- Serious injury\n- Injury location 1-8\n- Injury type 1-8\n\nNote: The spreadsheet contains a key tab (“Injury Data Key”) that explains the nature of the data (alphanumeric coding) in the “Injury Data” tab.\n\nREFERENCES:\nPublications that use this dataset must reference the following publication:\nRobinovitch SN, Feldman F, Yang Y, Schonnop R, Leung PM, Sarraf T, Sims-Gould J, and Loughin M: Video capture of the circumstances of falls in elderly people residing in long-term care: an observational study.

                                  Here we describe an innovative, integrative protocol that addresses the challenges of simultaneously using four recording technologies (EEG, head-mounted eye tracking, motion tracking, and video) to assess the neurophysiological factors underlying goal-directed behavior. This protocol is used successfully with adults and preschool-aged children and can be used in conjunction with any manual or locomotor task. To illustrate, we provide an example of a study on problem solving with a manual tool use task. The EEG and eye tracking revealed motor planning and its absence prior to the first movement. The motion tracking and video revealed the efficiency of participants' problem-solving strategies.</span>

                                                                                                                                                                                                              We investigated infants’ understanding of words that refer to action events. Based on the argument that changes in motor abilities may have important influences on language development (Iverson, 2010), we hypothesize that differences in comprehension ability might be related to infants’ experiences with different kinds of motor actions. New motor abilities provide new opportunities for infants to explore their physical world (Smith et al., 2007). Direct experience with an action might enable infants to expand their comprehension abilities (Huttenlocher et al., 1983). Motor abilities also provide new opportunities for infants to engage with social partners and might prompt more talk about actions (Karasik et al. 2008; Reid et al., 2010). If motor experience influences vocabulary development, then infants might show better comprehension for actions with which they have more experience. We tested for comprehension of two types of action events in a split-screen preferential looking paradigm: seated posture with manual actions [splash-shake, wave-laugh, blow(bubbles)-eat(with a spoon)] and upright posture with gross motor actions [kick-throw, jump-run, walk-dance]. The participants were infants from rural small towns in Central Pennsylvania. The Ages and Stages survey was used to gather parent reports of the infants’ motor development. The MacArthur Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI) was used to estimate vocabulary. A parent report survey of how frequently the family used the target words was included to gather an estimate of exposure to these words. We assigned infants to a Younger or Older subject group based on the Ages and Stages standard that independent walking is typically developed by 15 months of age. Then, infants were assigned to either the "seated-manual" action condition or the "upright-gross motor" action condition. Each infant saw all three sets in each condition in a blocked presentation. Order of presentation and side of presentation were counterbalanced between subjects. Looking times were scored frame by frame from digital video recordings. Final analyses are in progress.</span>

vocalizations that researchers have referred to as a social “dance.” Does this dance continue when both partners are free to move across the floor? Locomotor synchrony was assessed in 13- to 19-month-old infant-mother dyads (N = 30) by tracking each partner’s step-to-step location during free play. Although infants moved more than mothers, dyads spontaneously synchronized their locomotor activity. For 27 dyads, the spatiotemporal path of one partner uniquely identified the path of the other. Clustering analyses revealed two patterns of synchrony (mother-follow, yo-yo), and infants were more likely than mothers to lead the dance. Like face-to-face synchrony, locomotor synchrony scaffolds infants’ interactions with the outside world.</span>

Video is publicly available and was derived from the Databrary volume databrary.org/volume/89.\n\nVideo 4. Real-time trace from remote eye tracker and accompanying video. Eye-tracking shows processed data representing infant’s shifts in gaze on the display. Video shows the physical and social context in which the behavior occurred. Video is publicly available and was derived from the Databrary volume databrary.org/volume/192.\n\nVideo 5. Multiple camera views of the same infant and caregiver behaviors. Fish-eye camera view (top left) shows the entire scene. Hand held, third-person camera view (top right) shows the events from an outsider’s perspective. First-person camera views show the events from the infant’s perspective (bottom left) and caregiver's perspective (bottom right). Video is publicly available and was derived from Databrary volume databrary.org/volume/135 at databrary.org/volume/135/slot/8351/-?asset=19611.\n\nVideo 6. Wearable head cameras show images in infant’s approximate field of view during natural activity in the home. Video is publicly available and was derived from the Databrary volume databrary.org/volume/112.\n\nVideo 7. Exemplar Datavyu spreadsheet of an infant and caregiver in 70s of natural activity in the home. Each column shows a behavior for the infant and the mother—the baby’s vocalizations and mother’s speech, functional language codes, emotion, object interactions, locomotion, and manual gestures. Each cell denotes the onset and offset of one behavior and cells are time-locked to the video. White cells denote events that have not yet happened, green cells are events currently happening on the video, red cells are events that have already happened. Spreadsheet shows temporal alignment among behaviors. Video is publicly available and was derived from the Databrary volume databrary.org/volume/872.\n\nVideo 8.

on only one domain of expertise. However, children’s development typically does not adhere to researchers’ siloed expertise. Instead, multiple psychological domains develop simultaneously and changes in one domain can cascade into developmental changes in domains far afield from the original accomplishment. This experiment focuses on the developmental relations between walking and talking. \nLearning to walk allows infants to explore the environment in new ways. Compared with crawling, walking infants go more places, see more of the surrounds, and access more distal toys for play. We test whether the changes instigated by walking have a cascading effect on infants’ language experiences. The central hypothesis is that walking prompts a developmental cascade, wherein: (1) walkers explore a wider variety of places and objects than crawlers; (2) enhanced exploration elicits different forms of language input from caregivers; and (3) differences in language input are related to infants’ receptive and productive vocabularies. \nInfants—half crawlers, half walkers—and their caregivers play together with toys in two conditions: (1) toys dispersed throughout a large playroom (high incentive to locomote); and (2) toys clustered in a pile (high incentive to remain stationary). We predict a walking status × condition interaction: Walkers will locomote more and access more toys than crawlers in the dispersed condition; in turn, caregivers will spontaneously respond with more diverse language input to walkers. However, when toys are clustered, crawlers and walkers will produce similarly low amounts of locomotion and similarly frequent interactions with toys, and caregivers will respond with similar language inputs to infants.</span>
