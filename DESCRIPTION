Description: This package provides commands to interact with the 
  Databrary.org API. There are some public assets on Databrary. 
  But for most interesting use cases, a user will need to 
  register <http://databrary.org/register> and receive authorization 
  from an institution. Once authorized, users can download data 
  and metadata from Databrary.
