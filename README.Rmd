## Overview

databraryr is a wrapper for the [Databrary](https://databrary.org) data library's application programming interface (API).
The package can be used to create reproducible data wrangling, analysis, and visualization pipelines from data stored and shared on Databrary.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The easiest way to install databraryr is from CRAN
install.packages("databraryr")

# The development release can be installed from GitHub
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("databrary/databraryr")
```

## Usage

Databrary ([databrary.org](https://databrary.org)) is a restricted-access research data library specialized for storing and sharing video with capabilities of storing [other types](https://nyu.databrary.org/asset/formats/) of associated data.
Access to restricted data requires registration and formal approval by an institution.
The registration process involves the creation of an (email-account-based) user account and secure password.
Once institutional authorization has been granted, a user may gain access to shared video, audio, and other data.
See <https://databrary.org/about.html> for more information about gaining access to restricted data.

However, many commands in the `databraryr` package return meaningful results *without* or *prior to* formal authorization.
These commands access public data or metadata.

```{r example}
library(databraryr)

get_db_stats()

list_volume_assets() |> 
  head()
```

## Lifecycle

Rick Gilmore has been using experimental versions of databraryr for many years, but the package was only released to CRAN in the fall of 2023.
Some new features are on the roadmap, but the package is largely stable.
